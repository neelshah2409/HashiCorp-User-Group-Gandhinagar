## About HashiCorp User Group [HUG] Gandhinagar Community

This group is a place to meet other developers and ops engineers using HashiCorp tools!

HashiCorp enables orgs to provision, secure, connect and run any infrastructure for any application. DevOps engineers use the HashiCorp product suite of Vagrant, Packer, Terraform, Vault, Nomad, Consul, Boundary, and Waypoint on a daily basis.

This group gathers HashiCorp Users to share valuable experiences and knowledge.

Join us to learn more about best practices and how others have solved infrastructure problems with the integration of HashiCorp tools.
